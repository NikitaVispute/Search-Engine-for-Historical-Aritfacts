The name Isidora (ICIDOPA) is written in Greek in red paint on the right upper shoulder of the mummy wrappings, and must refer to the deceased once encased in this “red shroud” mummy. The provenience of the original burial is unknown, however the curved top of the panel is commensurate with portraits found in Hawara, and a male “red-shroud” mummy has also been recovered there.

Its manufacture is therefore mostly limited to the approximately fifty years between 25 BC – AD 25. The most popular color scheme is opaque white glass layered over translucent deep blue glass. Although the workshop or workshops that produced this glass has not been found, it is presumed to have been located in Rome, where many fragments have been found. More pieces have been found in Pompeii and around the Bay of Naples, where powerful Romans spent their leisure time."

The kore (young woman) stands with her weight on her left leg and her right leg forward. She wears a garment called a peplos, a rectangular piece of heavy cloth folded over at the top, pinned at the shoulders, and usually worn belted. Even in the statue's damaged state, the garment is identifiable by the overfold above the figure's waist. Little of the figure’s anatomy is actually visible, except for the contour of her right thigh, which is revealed as she pulls the fabric of her peplos to the side. In addition, the upper part of her bare upper arms is preserved in side views. This gesture is typical of the kore statue type, in which one hand was usually extended with an offering to the gods while the other grasped the fabric of the dress below the waist."

Made in Rome, it belonged to Pope Paul V Borghese (ruled 1605-21), whose coat of arms (the eagle and the dragon) is featured above the central niche. Already in an English private collection by 1821 when it was offered for sale with its stand in London, the cabinet was then acquired by King George IV (ruled 1820-30). It remained in the British Royal Collection until 1959, when it was sold with the collection of Queen Mary. Such showpiece cabinets–brilliantly colored in their use of precious materials, but also intriguing with their multiple drawers–were the most prestigious display furniture in Europe from the late sixteenth to early eighteenth century. They were used to store such treasures as medals, gems, and small bronzes or ivories, as well as private documents. Designed to resemble the façade of a Baroque church, the Borghese-Windsor Cabinet is exceptional in its large size and sumptuous decoration. Expensive and difficult to cut and polish, the numerous hard stones ('pietre dure' in Italian) covering the front in elaborate geometrical and chromatic patterns demonstrate the rarity of this piece. The statuettes, with draperies in gilt bronze and with heads, hands, and legs in silver, add to its luxuriousness. The stand on which the cabinet sits was created for it in the 1820s, and is an impressive architectural piece of furniture in its own right. Its shape elegantly follows that of the cabinet, the front breaking forward in the center to conform to its footprint. With a mirrored backboard, it is composed of a sober podium on top of which twenty-four fluted Ionic columns in solid ebony support the upper table adorned with a frieze of lacquered brass foliated scrolls."

These objects help identify the figure, since Herakles was often depicted with a club and the skin of the Nemean Lion, which he killed as his first labor. As is typical for depictions of Greek heroes, the young Herakles is shown nude, since the Greeks considered male nudity to be the highest form of beauty. No other god or hero is as frequently depicted in Greek and Roman art as is Herakles."

In Greek mythology, the singing of the Sirens lured sailors to their deaths, and so these mythical figures are often connected with the deceased. The seated man is also a singer, as shown by his open mouth and the pick (plektron) with which he plays his now-missing lyre, once cradled in his left arm. His precise identity, however, is uncertain. He might be Orpheus, who was famous for his singing and who helped Jason and his crew safely sail past the Sirens. But in art of the fourth century BC, Orpheus is usually shown wearing an elaborately embroidered costume that is not seen here. Therefore, the seated figure may be a mortal in the guise of a poet or singer. The precise meaning of the group has been the subject of extensive speculation, but perhaps the singer should be seen as prevailing over the Sirens and triumphing over death."

Sitting erect on a simple four-legged stool with his face lifted in song, he plays a frame harp—a stringed instrument that originated in the Near East—while resting his right hand on its sound box. The extension at the top, a common feature on ancient stringed instruments, facilitated the projection of the sound. Originally the figure’s eyes and hair were added in paint. This challenging composition of a seated player, stool, and delicate frame was shaped from a block of solid marble and then patiently ground down with pumice and emery, locally available abrasives. The resulting three-dimensional design is a masterpiece of Bronze Age sculpture."

Further complicating the pose, the man looks at the ground and steps on a bellows. Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries based the composition of this bronze statue on a famous Hellenistic marble of a dancing faun, which Michelangelo was believed to have restored while it was in the collection of the Medici in Florence. Although de Vries borrowed the original statue's composition, he replaced the faun's foot organ with a bellows and substituted plates for the faun's cymbals."

Antinous is shown here in profil facing to the left; a fibula pins his chlamys in place at his left shoulder. Over his right shoulder, he carries a hunting spear. Behind his left shoulder is a fragmentary vertical inscription written in retrograde Greek letters, beginning ΑΝΤΟ…, perhaps the name of the gem engraver.

The intaglio is fragmentary; a portion of the bust, fibula, and drapery have been restored in gold as part of a more modern mount."

On this figure, the radiate crown behind his head and spreading wings identify the god. Usil wears a diadem, necklace, and a mantle over his shoulders, which falls to either side in pleated folds. Nude from the groin up, he has disproportionately long arms and large hands. At the top of the thighs the figure merges into a broad plate decorated with undulating lines indicating the waves from which the sun god emerges and sinks at daybreak and dusk. A projecting lug is hollow behind to accommodate a wood or metal structure, to which the relief was attached by three pairs of rivets. 

The rare examples of Usil appliqués are associated with burials, which often held grave offerings of funerary carts and chariots. Driven in ceremonial processions, elaborate wood vehicles were covered with sheet bronze repoussé and fitted with cast animal-head protomes. Figural reliefs such as this are interpreted as decorative attachments on the sideboards, used to cover structural elements of the vehicle."

Her oval face, turned slightly to her left, has a thin nose with wide nostrils, small mouth with full, closed lips, and dimpled chin. A long veil with scalloped upper edges covers most of her head along with a tightly bound “turban” with a central loop, but her long, thick hair nonetheless flows out from a central part in abundant waves. She wears a light, long-sleeved tunic and pulls a heavier fringed mantle tightly around her. Her right hand protrudes from her garment and her elongated fingers grasp its edge in a gesture associated with the virtue of modesty in ancient Roman funerary reliefs. Her lowered left arm crosses her body diagonally and the hand, with fingers extended, rests below her right elbow. Her long neck, with the pronounced fleshy folds conventionally called “Venus rings” by scholars of ancient art, is adorned by a beaded necklace, and she also wears pendant earrings and a jeweled ring on the now-broken little finger of her left hand.

Seen from below, suggesting that the model stood on a raised platform, the saint looms large and monumental. The artist Juan Conchillos Falco modeled his figure using the blue as a middle tone. Charcoal and white watercolor forcefully articulate the anatomical form of the saint, and convey his powerful presence. Saint John's musculature is dramatically portrayed in gritty black lines built up in bold succession. The summary treatment of the drapery, executed in broad, jagged strokes, gives the saint's clothing an abstract quality that reiterates the drawing's primary purpose as a study of the male body. On close examination, the charcoal's rough texture reflects glints of light, creating a seamless marriage between medium, technique, and subject."

While taking food to workers in a field, the prophet Habakkuk is interrupted by an angel who instructs him to deliver the meal instead to Daniel trapped in the lions’ den in Babylon. Here the encounter between Habakkuk and the angel is depicted in the foreground, the prophet holds a large bowl with high handles, and reapers are shown in the middle ground. The two figures are seen again at the top of the composition with the angel holding Habbakuk by the hair while carrying him to the city of Babylon, seen in the background. This panel was probably one of a series by Wouter Crabeth illustrating episodes from the Book of Daniel. Wouter and his elder brother Dirck were the most famous Netherlandish glass painters of the sixteenth century, admired especially for their windows produced for the Sint Janskerk at Gouda."

http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/328113/edme-bouchardon-hercules-subduing-the-centaurs-french-about-1735-1740/,Hercules Subduing the Centaurs,"Wielding his chalk with characteristic grace and precision, Bouchardon carved out his grappling figures from the shadows of an imagined grotto. At center, the hero Hercules--recognizable by a lion's skin worn around his waist and a knotty club in his grasp--straddles one thrashing centaur and prepares to deal the other a mighty blow. Though this scene is fantastical, the straining human and equine anatomy seems observed firsthand. Bold, decisive contour lines enclose each figure, setting the group apart, in crisp relief, from the rapid red chalk hatch-work of the rugged plinth and alcove. These rocky forms and the overturned jar at right confirm that the drawing represents an unrealized design for a grotto fountain. 
The story of Hercules's battle with the centaurs is usually told in the context of his fourth labor. On his way to Mount Erymanthos, Hercules pays a visit to the cave of his friend the centaur Pholus, whom he persuades to open a jar of wine originally given by Bacchus to all the centaurs. Smelling the wine, Pholus's fellow centaurs arrive to discover Hercules drinking from their jar; failing to understand that wine should be mixed with water, they begin to drink it undiluted and then set upon Hercules in anger. He subdues them with poisoned arrows and eventually continues on his way to kill the Erymanthian boar. Curiously, in Bouchardon's rendition of the scene, Hercules wields not a bow and poisoned arrows but his accustomed club. The artist here apparently sacrificed a certain measure of fidelity to the story in favor of a more thrilling and direct confrontation between the hero and his intoxicated foes, tangled together in a mass of muscle and hair. The cave setting of the story made it ideally suited for depiction in a fountain sculpture; in a witty detail devised by Bouchardon, water would have flowed from the centaurs' supposedly undiluted wine jug at right."

There is a sense of absolute stillness, broken only by the suggestion that the open-mouthed Christ is pronouncing his last words: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34). The relatively small size, the delicacy of the brushwork, and the precious support on copper indicate that the painting was intended for private devotion."
